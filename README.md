# JPdatatool
EkspSys-project 2017.

Simple data analysis tool made specifically for the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, based on their needs.

This is only a limited-functionality prototype. Data analysis was made using the Python (Pandas)[http://pandas.pydata.org/] library. Server functionality implemented using (Flask)[http://flask.pocoo.org/]. Frontend made using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with the libraries (jQuery)[https://jquery.com/] and (D3.js)[https://d3js.org/].

# How to use
**Requires Python 3.**
`cd` into the `app` folder.
Run `python server.py`.
Open `http://localhost:5000` in a browser -- this is the only URL that will work.

You can select any (or none) of the filters and click "Generate result" to see some graphs. Some of the available buttons have no functionality -- they are just dummy objects.
